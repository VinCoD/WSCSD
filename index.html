We mobilize individuals and volunteers from public and private organizations, not for profit institutions, community-based organizations, and corporates from all walks of life to take part is this annual event. We also conduct monthly beach clean-up events along Galu Beach in South Coast by encouraging volunteers to visit the beaches and remove trash to keep our beaches clean. The data on the trash collected from the clean-up events is shared with Ocean Conservancy’s Ocean trash data index to help in research and education on marine ecology. We segregate the trash collected from the beach into recyclable, reusable, and compostable to ensure that they are disposed safely to avoid chances of the trash collected getting back to the beaches.

                          WSCSD-Kenya takes advantage of the intersection between different economic sectors to promote the creation of new products and services with economic, social, and tourism value. Our cross-cutting sectors of intervention are; <br>                        
                          1.	<strong> Tourism and Cultural Heritage: Tourism and Cultural Heritage resource center</strong><br>
                          We intend to achieve this goal through the development of the Tourism and Cultural Heritage resource center in association with the marine environment, fisheries, research, education, social action, capacity building, enhancement of creative, technical capacities in local communities through the development of business plans, marketing, publicity, and media outreach to leverage their competitiveness in the international tourist market.<br>
                          2.	<strong>Entrepreneurship: Mazingira Art and Entrepreneurship</strong><br> 
                          We tap into the cultural heritage, innovation, creativity, and intellectual property of the local communities to produce goods and services with cultural, social, and economic significance. Our intervention nurtures entrepreneurship skills that contribute to the creation of formal employment and leverage the competitiveness of tangible and intangible cultural heritage as source of tourist attraction. We do this by dentifying and incubating innovative business startups that integrate tourism, cultural heritage, creativity, intellectual property rights, and marine environment to create economic, social, and cultural value to the local communities. <br>
                          3.	<strong>Technology: Utamaduni Na Utalii Mtandaoni</strong><br>
                          This project encourages the adoption of technology in the field of sustainable tourism and Cultural Heritage through the use of an online library for wide dissemination and marketing of products and/or services made from the intersection of cultural heritage, creativity, and innovation of the local communities. This digital platform will be communication, advertising, and marketing campaign tool for WSCSD-Kenya to promote access to sustainable tourism and local cultural heritage to new internal and external markets. <br>
                          4.	<strong>Education: Science without borders challenge</strong><br>
                          The Science without borders challenge focuses on the creation and expansion of festivals and international professional fairs in sustainable tourism and Cultural Heritage through formal education and professional training projects. <br>
                          5.	<strong>Innovation, Creativity, Intellectual properties/Job Creation: Community Waste Recycling Plant</strong><br>
                          WSCSD-Kenya operates a local solid waste recycling plant where marine debris and trash collected during beach cleanup is sorted, segregated, and safely disposed of to prevent the chance of the trash getting back to the beach. The waste recycling plants employ 100 local communities that convert the recyclable trash into reusable products and combustible trash into compost manure for agricultural use.</p>

Our focus is primarily on charismatic threatened marine wildlife and megafauna, and more specifically on elasmobranchs (sharks, rays and skates) and their habitats. Most of our projects in this field have the capacity to make a real difference to the health of the oceans and to the survival of threatened aquatic species and habitats. With a view to achieving this aim, WSCSD-Kenya nurtures students and early career scientists working on exceptional projects, on remarkable species or habitats and/or in unique locations. WSCSD-Kenya aims to support research, conservation or educational activities capable of attracting significant public attention to genuinely increase public and government awareness of the urgent need to protect the marine environment.

                        <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                          Seaweed can play a huge role in fighting climate change by absorbing carbon emissions, regenerating marine ecosystems, creating biofuel and renewable plastics as well as generating marine protein. The seaweed grows underwater for 45 days. When it reaches one kilogram it is picked and dried, then packed in bags to be exported to countries like China, Korea and Vietnam where it is used as medicines and shampoos.</p>
                          <p>WSCSD-Kenya trans local communities along the south coast of Kenya on seaweed farming to equip them with skills and competence in making soap from their seaweed at the Zanzibar Seaweed Center, a business that started as an NGO in 2009. At their homes, they mix water, ground seaweed powder, coconut oil, caustic soda and essential oils in a large plastic tub. WSCSD-Kenya helps the seaweed farmers market their soaps to both local and international markets. As seaweed levels decline, local communities find way to increase the value of their work.</p>

                          On 24th November 2022, European Union, Jumuia ya County Za Pwani, Kwale County department of Trade, Tourism, and ICT, Camoes, and World Student Community for Sustainable Development (WSCSD-Kenya) launched the Tourism Cultural Heritage Business Development Project under the GoBlue Component 1, output 3 on growth (grants for business) aimed at accelerating the engagement of women and youth in the tourism sector. The project which is funded by the European Union and Camoes at a cost of KShs. 6 million aims at supporting 400 women and youth-led agribusiness enterprises across Kenya. It is projected to create of 1000 job opportunities. It addresses key challenges that hinder youth and women from tapping into the immense potential in the tourism, culture, and heritage of the coastal communities while tapping on the ICT and unexploited potential of the hidden treasure in the sector.  The Tourism Cultural Heritage Business Development Project is being implemented jointly with Kwale county governments department of trade, tourism, and ICT and Jumuia Ya County Za Pwani to benefit local communities in Kwale. A Digital Business Incubation, Innovation, and ICT Hub has been set up in Ukunda, Kwale County to provide training, business advisory, and financing to enable women and youth to gain the requisite skills needed to scale their businesses in tourism, culture, and heritage sector. WSCSD-K is placing a call for applications to enroll women and youth tourism, culture, and heritage entrepreneurs into the project.  Successful applicants benefit from tourism, culture, and heritage entrepreneurship opportunities available within their localities as well as the other services offered within the Digital Business Incubation, Innovation, and ICT Hub.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4 tm-intro-text">
                          WSCSD-Kenya takes advantage of the intersection between different economic sectors to promote the creation of new products and services with economic, social, and tourism value. Our cross-cutting sectors of intervention are; <br>                        
                          1.	<strong> Tourism and Cultural Heritage: Tourism and Cultural Heritage resource center</strong><br>
                          We intend to achieve this goal through the development of the Tourism and Cultural Heritage resource center in association with the marine environment, fisheries, research, education, social action, capacity building, enhancement of creative, technical capacities in local communities through the development of business plans, marketing, publicity, and media outreach to leverage their competitiveness in the international tourist market.<br>
                          2.	<strong>Entrepreneurship: Mazingira Art and Entrepreneurship</strong><br> 
                          We tap into the cultural heritage, innovation, creativity, and intellectual property of the local communities to produce goods and services with cultural, social, and economic significance. Our intervention nurtures entrepreneurship skills that contribute to the creation of formal employment and leverage the competitiveness of tangible and intangible cultural heritage as source of tourist attraction. We do this by dentifying and incubating innovative business startups that integrate tourism, cultural heritage, creativity, intellectual property rights, and marine environment to create economic, social, and cultural value to the local communities. <br>
                          3.	<strong>Technology: Utamaduni Na Utalii Mtandaoni</strong><br>
                          This project encourages the adoption of technology in the field of sustainable tourism and Cultural Heritage through the use of an online library for wide dissemination and marketing of products and/or services made from the intersection of cultural heritage, creativity, and innovation of the local communities. This digital platform will be communication, advertising, and marketing campaign tool for WSCSD-Kenya to promote access to sustainable tourism and local cultural heritage to new internal and external markets. <br>
                          4.	<strong>Education: Science without borders challenge</strong><br>
                          The Science without borders challenge focuses on the creation and expansion of festivals and international professional fairs in sustainable tourism and Cultural Heritage through formal education and professional training projects. <br>
                          5.	<strong>Innovation, Creativity, Intellectual properties/Job Creation: Community Waste Recycling Plant</strong><br>
                          WSCSD-Kenya operates a local solid waste recycling plant where marine debris and trash collected during beach cleanup is sorted, segregated, and safely disposed of to prevent the chance of the trash getting back to the beach. The waste recycling plants employ 100 local communities that convert the recyclable trash into reusable products and combustible trash into compost manure for agricultural use.</p>
